# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## 🧾 Program
```
try:
    # Taking 3 elements input from the user
    L = []
    for i in range(3):
        item = ['laptop','mobile','pen']
        L.append(item)

    # Trying to access index 4
    print(L[4])
except IndexError:
    print("check index range")
```

## Output

<img width="506" height="225" alt="518002297-d3ebc277-3549-49b8-a621-3a8446f8c34e" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aee233d-cd65-4268-a137-b1ec43f1365c" />

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
